I'm going to write a tutorial for deep learning engineering practice.

here's the outline(still in drafting):

- deep learning basics, i.e. math, focusing on intuitiveness
- linear regression and logistic regression
- nueral networks in practice
- language model concepts and basics
- transformers basics and practice
